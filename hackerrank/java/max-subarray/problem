Given an array  of  elements, find the maximum possible sum of a

Contiguous subarray
Non-contiguous (not necessarily contiguous) subarray.
Empty subarrays/subsequences should not be considered.

Input Format

First line of the input has an integer .  cases follow. 
Each test case begins with an integer . In the next line,  integers follow representing the elements of array .

Constraints:

The subarray and subsequences you consider should have at least one element.

Output Format

Two, space separated, integers denoting the maximum contiguous and non-contiguous subarray. At least one integer should be selected and put into the subarrays (this may be required in cases where all elements are negative).

Sample Input

2 
4 
1 2 3 4
6
2 -1 2 3 4 -5
Sample Output

10 10
10 11
Explanation

In the first case: 
The max sum for both contiguous and non-contiguous elements is the sum of ALL the elements (as they are all positive).

In the second case: 
[2 -1 2 3 4] --> This forms the contiguous sub-array with the maximum sum. 
For the max sum of a not-necessarily-contiguous group of elements, simply add all the positive elements.
